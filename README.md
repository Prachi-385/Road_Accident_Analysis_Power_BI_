# Project: Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)
Tools Used: Power BI, SQL Server, DAX, Excel
Domain: Public Safety / Transportation Analytics

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify key patterns, risk factors, and trends contributing to casualties. The dashboard provides
a comprehensive, interactive view of accident statistics to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions for improving road safety.

# Objective
To analyze casualty trends across multiple dimensions such as vehicle type, location, weather conditions, road type, and day/night patterns.
To compare current year (CY) performance with previous year (PY) and highlight areas requiring attention.

# Key Insights Delivered
- Total CY Casualties: 26K (-16.2%)
- Total CY Accidents: 19K (-15.1%)
- CY Fatal Casualties: 288 (-42.4%)
- CY Serious Casualties: 3150 (-24.4%)
- CY Slight Casualties: 23K (-14.3%)

# Dashboard Highlights
- Casualties by Vehicle Type: Breakdown of casualties involving cars, bikes, buses, vans, agricultural vehicles, and others.
- Urban vs Rural Analysis: Urban areas contributed ~60% whereas rural areas contributed ~40% of total casualties.
- Casualties by Road Type: Single carriageways had the highest casualties (~19K).
- Day vs Night Comparison: Majority of incidents occurred during the day (64%).
- Weather Condition Filters: Fine, Rain, Snow/Ice, Other.
- Location-Based Analysis: City-wise casualty distribution using average latitude and longitude.
- Trend Analysis: Month-wise comparison of CY vs PY casualties using a line area chart.

# Technical Implementation
a) Data Preparation:
- Imported Excel dataset into Power BI
- Performed data cleaning, missing value checks, and normalization
- Used SQL Server for additional data validation and query-based transformations

b) DAX Measures Created:
- YoY % change formulas
- Casualty category counts
- Dynamic slicer-based measures

c) Dashboard Design:
- Used a dark-gradient background for better readability
- Applied data cards, donut charts, bar charts, matrix tables, and slicers
- Ensured responsive layout with interactive user filters

d) Outcome
- Delivered a visually intuitive and actionable dashboard that helps stakeholders understand accident patterns and implement safety measures.
- Enhanced interpretation of road accident trends using powerful analytics and clean data modeling.
